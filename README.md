Hi Joāo

Here are some examples of recent work I’ve been producing:

Plat_PI_GreGam_NC_FR_300x600_RM				
This expandable banner was coded using Sass.

sca_52421_footer-master							
This is a footer that I had to code for a project using media queries.

Expanding__970x250_Video_to_970x500_YouTube		
This was an expandable banner I recently coded prior to the Wimbledon Tennis Tournament 2016.

Please feel free to give me a shout if you have any questions!

Thanks<br>
Johnny
